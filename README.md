# Roll20 GMTools
## Overview
GMTools.js is a script that can be loaded into Roll20 to create and execute various Macros that alleviate some of the busywork of GMing a typical D&D style tabletop game.

The script listens for chat messages that begin with the "!" prefix. These messages can be typed manually, but it's better to use Macro buttons to deliver the messages for you. Use the !reset command in chat to create all of the macros used by this script. This will also delete existing macros with the same names.


## Macros

### Group-Initiative (Token Action)
Rolls Initiative for the selected token(s), displaying the results in chat and adding each token to the turn order. Requires each token to have "Bar1_Value" set to their initiative modifier.

### Group-Saves (Token Action)
TBD
